# Prism removes consensus bottleneck for smart contracts

## Build

This project requires Rust `nightly`. To build the binary, run `cargo build --release`.

The first build could take several mintues, mostly due to building dependencies from Ethereum.

## Testbed and Reproducing

The scripts used in the evaluation section of the paper are located in `/testbed`. `/testbed/README.md` provides instructions for running the experiments and reproducing the results.
